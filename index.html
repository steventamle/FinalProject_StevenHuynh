            <p>
                Angel Feather is a versatile clan that focuses on manipulating the damage zone and using it as a
                toolbox. They can build a field by superior calling cards from the damage zone and swapping cards from
                the hand with the damage zone. Many of their effects reward damage zone manipulation, mostly in the form
                of increased power or shield value. They can further manipulate the damage zone by healing and
                inflicting damage on themselves with the purpose of activating triggers during the damage check. Also
                some units can get Power or activate skills if your opponent has a new card in its damage zone, to get
                more easily some units can change rearguards with card from damage zone.

            <h1><b>Genesis</b></h1>
            <img src="Icon_Genesis.png" alt="">
            <p>
                Genesis is known for having a "jack of all trades" playstyle, due to their unique theme of Soul Blasting
                as a cost to activate different kinds of effects. Some units have their abilities activated when they
                are Soul Blasted, others can change the number of cards an ability may require to Soul Blast, and some
                can even gain power or trigger effects. Aside from Soul Blasting, Genesis also deals with the Equip
                Gauge, with their unique title being "Divine Equip Gauge" (神装しんそう ゲージ
                Shinsō Gēji). The "Divine Equip Gauge" is reminiscent of a Soul Blast; moving a card from the soul into
                a unit's Equip
                Gauge rather than into the drop zone.

            <h1><b>Nubatama</b></h1>
            <img src="Icon_Nubatama.png" alt="">
            <p>
                Nubatama is a control based clan that focuses on cutting down the opponent's hand. Nubatama generally
                lacks in aggresive potential, so instead they weaken the opponent's hand to make it harder for the
                opponent to defend against their attacks. The main way they do this is by bouncing an opponent's
                rear-guard back to their hand then forcing the opponent to discard a card, which weakens their field and
                forces them to either lose potential Shields to keep the bounced card or lose that important rear-guard.
                They can also directly discard a card from the opponent's hand, and in some cases limit how many cards
                the opponent can have in their hand at the end of the turn, forcing them to discard the rest. In
                addition to this, Nubatama also uses multiple cards with "When placed" abilities that can be reused by
                bouncing them and calling them again.

            <img src="Icon_NovaGrappler.png" alt="">
            <p>
                Nova Grapplers have a high-risk, high-reward playstyle in which they deliver multiple high-powered
                attacks at the expense of resources to quickly take down the opponent. This is accomplished through
                standing their rearguards during the battle phase and power-increasing card effects that require the
                player to commit cards from their hand to the field. Nova Grappler tends to sacrifice defensiveness for
                additional powerhouse offense, so they aim to defeat the opponent faster.
